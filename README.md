# Krystal
This is a Discord bot I made as a custom auto-moderator and fun thing for my server - it's basically like Dyno or Mee6 and is used to automate various things in a server except because I'm me I decided to make my own for the extra coolness factor.

This was developed sometime between me being 15-17. I think I stopped early onto age 17, focusing more on Kuro and CoronaNews as their popularity exploded.

Krystal was always a private bot and served as a little helper for me in a lot of tasks that I didn't want Kuro or CoronaNews doing as they were used by so many people.

I've kept the databases in JSON on purpose so that anyone looking at this can see how the bot stored data. I don't intend anyone to clone this or use it (in fact, it's a little difficult as I never made a package.json for this bot), this is here only as a sort of museum piece to what I developed in my teenage years.
